      <h4>üí∞Automated Trading in Cryptocurrency Market based on Predictions using Deep Learning</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The main goal of this project is to investigate the existence of methods for predicting cryptocurrency prices and then simulating 
          an automatic trading strategy based on that prediction; So that it can be used to make a profit in the digital currency markets. 
          This attempt can not only be an important step in the field of automatic trading of cryptocurrencies, but also
          it can help financial analysts to better evaluate and increase their confidence about the future of this market.
          In this project, an attempt has been made to first design a model that has the ability to predict in a suitable 
          period of time with acceptable accuracy. We used LSTM model for this purpose. In the second stage, an attempt has been made to design a strategy for 
          automatic trading using the built model in such a way that these transactions will eventually lead to profit.
        </p>
        <p>In the pictures below, there is the result of predictions of Bitcoin using LSTM model and financial Indicators. This is a consecutive prediction.

        <p>Here is the accuracy and obtained signals for the autotrading process:</p>

        <hr>
        <p>This project has been done in a group of three members using agile methods. This is a website in which students can register and after 
          they are validated by admins, they can sell or buy goods like their foods or books. Moreover a feature is implemented to let organizations 
          put their job offers and hire the best suit among all the students. Similarly, students can upload their resume for their desired job offers.
          The following pictures are some screenshots from this website!

      <h4>üë¶68 Facial Points Detection</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>We carried out a project in which the trained model could detect faces in an input picture and recognize 68 facial points for every 
          face in the image. Python libraries like numpy, pickle, tensorflow and keras were used to create a sequential CNN model and the training process
          was run on the google colab!
